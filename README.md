# Model-Igem-2023-INSA-ENS-Lyon1-SuperBugBuster
You'll find here the codes used for the 2 types of simulations carried out as part of our Model for the iGEM 2023 competition, team INSA ENS Lyon1.  The IBM code corresponds to individual-centered modeling. The Model code corresponds to simulations based on our main model: the autonomous differential equation model.
